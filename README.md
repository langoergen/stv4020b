# Expectations and tips
1. We will use significantly less time on basics -- you need to know:
    - How to load data in different formats
    - How to structure R-files in folders and keep everything tidy
    - How to install and load external packages
    - How to do basic recoding (ifelse, which, etc)
    - How to make nice graphs (plot or ggplot)
    - How to run basic regression models in R (lm, glm, lmer, etc)
2. It is important to know the basics and importance of replicating standing studies
    - See this article by [Garry King](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/replication.pdf)
3. Remember that R is hard, at first. With practice, however, it is not that bad
4. If you need repetition/introduction to the basics, look over the material from [STV4020A](https://github.com/martigso/stv4020aR)
5. The material from the seminars will be available at [github](https://github.com/martigso/stv4020b)
